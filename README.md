# Python_Data_Analysis
 A collection of notebooks I created for various data analysis topics, all using Python.

Probably the best way to make use of this is to create a separate virtual environment, activate it (if it's not already activated) and then use the included requirements.txt to populate that environment (*pip install -r requirements.txt*). You should then be able to run **jupyter lab**, as well as **spyder3**, with the terminal and notebook addons installed.

The notebooks in the **notebooks** folder were created based on the following.
* **The ones number 1 - 4** - these were written as I was going through Wes McKinney's book, "Python for Data Analysis" (O'Reilly Media; 2 edition September 25, 2017)
* **Statistics 1 - 10** - these are based on the excellent video course found here:

* **plotnine & ggplot** - both of these are actually based on the **plotnine** library. It is virtually an exact clone of Hadley Wickham's *ggplot2* library for R. After trying out matplotlib, seaborn, ggpy and plotnine, I found plotnine to be far and away the best choice *for me*. I won't go into my reasons because 1) I abhor getting into language/library flame wars (life is too short to waste on juvenile idiocy; unless it involves pulling someone's pants down in public. Because that's just hilarious) and 2) graphing is very, very subjective.
