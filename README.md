# Python_Data_Analysis
 A collection of notebooks I created for various data analysis topics, all using Python.

Probably the best way to make use of this is to create a separate virtual environment and then use the included requirements.txt to populate that environment (pip install -r requirements.txt). You should then be able to run jupyter lab, as well as spyder3, with the terminal and notebook addons installed.
